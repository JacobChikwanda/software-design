## Course Title
Software Design

## Course Code
BSE 2210

## Prerequisites
- Introduction to Programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description
This course covers the principles and practices of software design, including design patterns, software architecture, and the use of modeling languages. Students will learn to design software systems that are efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of software design.
- Apply design patterns to solve common software design problems.
- Develop software architectures that meet specified requirements.
- Use UML and other modeling languages to design software systems.
- Evaluate and improve the design of existing software systems.
