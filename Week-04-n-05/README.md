# UML Assignment - Library Management System

## Objective
In this assignment, you will create three types of UML diagrams for a **Library Management System**: a Class Diagram, a Use Case Diagram, and a Sequence Diagram. By the end of this assignment, you should feel comfortable working with these diagrams and understand their significance in software design.

## Instructions
1. **Use a Free Online Tool**: Create your diagrams using a free online tool such as [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

2. **Refer to Resources**: For insights and guidance on how to draw these diagrams, refer to [GeeksforGeeks: UML Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-introduction/).

## Diagram Requirements

1. **Class Diagram**:
   - Identify the main classes in the Library Management System, such as `Book`, `Member`, and `Librarian`.
   - Include attributes (e.g., `title`, `author`, `ISBN` for `Book`) and methods (e.g., `borrow()`, `return()`) for each class.
   - Show relationships between classes (e.g., associations, inheritance).

2. **Use Case Diagram**:
   - Identify the main actors interacting with the system, such as `Member` and `Librarian`.
   - Define key use cases like `Borrow Book`, `Return Book`, and `Search Catalog`.
   - Illustrate the relationships between actors and use cases.

3. **Sequence Diagram**:
   - Choose a specific use case, such as `Borrow Book`.
   - Identify the objects involved (e.g., `Member`, `Book`, `Library System`).
   - Detail the interactions between these objects, showing the sequence of messages exchanged.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Class Diagram
- **Identify Classes**: Choose the main classes in the Library Management System.
- **Define Attributes and Methods**: List relevant attributes and methods for each class.
- **Show Relationships**: Draw lines to represent relationships between classes.

### Step 2: Use Case Diagram
- **Identify Actors**: List the users interacting with the system (e.g., `Member`, `Librarian`).
- **Define Use Cases**: Write down the main functionalities (e.g., `Borrow Book`, `Return Book`).
- **Connect Actors and Use Cases**: Draw lines to indicate which actors interact with which use cases.

### Step 3: Sequence Diagram
- **Select a Use Case**: Choose the `Borrow Book` use case.
- **Identify Objects**: List objects involved in this use case (e.g., `Member`, `Book`, `Library`).
- **Map Interactions**: Draw vertical lines for each object and use arrows to represent messages exchanged.

## Submission
- **Submit your diagrams using Google Forms**: Upload your diagrams as a PDF with images and brief explanations. [Here](https://forms.gle/HEUufY8jCHGR3H9s5)
- **Include a brief explanation** (1-2 sentences) for each diagram and its role in the Library Management System.

## Due Date
- **This assignment is due today by 24 hours.**

## Grading Criteria
- Clarity and accuracy of diagrams (50%)
- Completeness of all required elements (30%)
- Creativity and effort in presenting the diagrams (20%)

## Tools
- You can use the following free tools to create your diagrams:
  - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com)
  - [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

Good luck, and enjoy designing your UML diagrams for the Library Management System!
